**Description:** Version Î±5 of my submission for Ironhacks. Added a function to change the color of a district upon clicking so as to not deliver a completely empty product. Added an apology.

**Addendum:** I was unable to finish my submission for Ironhacks. The competition began when I was nearing the end of my semester, and as such I was swamped with responsibilities from many different courses I have been taking, such as tests and project deliveries. When you are swamped with responsibility in an university, some things tend to fall by the wayside - in my case, it was Ironhacks that didn't receive the attention it needed. For this competition we were all forced to use technologies some of us have never even seen in our lives, and I lacked both the time and energy to learn how to properly use them in what little spare time I had between working on homework and studying for my other courses. I refuse to let my average plummet just to turn in something the Ironhacks staff might like.

Call this a sob story if you will - it probably is. I have said my part and I have no regrets.
